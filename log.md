## Day one: Thursday 5 July

I am working on deploying machine learning algorithm that helps predict if breast cancer is cancerous or not.

* I have the data set
* I have prepared the notebook
* I have done pre-data processing

### Thoughts: I am just a beginner at this but I am really engaging myself to grow so far so good.
### Link: <a href = "https://github.com/atwine/100-Days-Of-ML-Code/blob/master/Week%209%20Major%20Project.ipynb">commit</a>


## Day two: Friday 6th July

Today I worked on Data processing and feature selection in my cancer project:
The aim is to find which are the best features that i can use in the machine learning algorithm for the best predictive results

Some of the things I want to do are:
* Deploy SVM, KNN and KMeans
* Use PCA to reduce dimensions
* Normalize results of the data I have before I deploy the models

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Link: <a href = "https://github.com/atwine/100-Days-Of-ML-Code/blob/master/Week%209%20Major%20Project.ipynb">commit</a>

### Thoughts: Just really excited to see what I can do over the period that I have spent learning ML


## Day three: Sat 7th July 2018

Today I am going to look at deploying Decision tree algorithms for a dataset that I got from Kaggle. This dataset was given by a bank to assist predict which  candidates are able to pay their loans.

* Deploy Decision Tree
* Make my first submission on kaggle for the results I get

>> #### this is going to be an interesting time, i still feel like I have things mixed up though the other reason why this is the time to make things better.


I am alittle stuck though: how do i extract into csv the information for the kmeans classifier to deal with it? I feel somewhat confused.


## Day four: Sun 8th July 2018

Today I watched a tutorial from Raj on implementing linear regression technique from scratch.

I am doing some studying on different algorithms: <a href = "https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/common-machine-learning-algorithms/">link</a>

I forked some  github repository to assist me learn more about these algorithm implementations: <a href = "https://github.com/atwine/machine-learning">link</a>

Reviewed machine learning implementations of peers in edx.org

## Day five: Mon 9th July 2018

=======
### Thoughts: Just really excited to see what I can do over the period that I have spent learning ML

Today I am taking time to look through various algorithms as much as possible and also to practice my programming. I had a question on how I could produce a resulting dataset but now I have the answer to it.

### I predict in the near days I will be able to do much more seeing that I have kinda made it through the novice stages.

I have looked at these today:
* 1. Linear Regression
* 2. Logistics regression
* 3. Got an sklearn cheat sheet which drew a great picture on how the info works.
* 4. Decision tree algorithm
* 5. Support Vector Machines
* 6. Read a chapter collective intelligence.pdf

>> what is amazing is that the decision tree algorithm was able to classify the information 100% correct which is quite amazing in comparison to what i have seen so far.


## Day six: Tue 10th July 2018

Today is a continuation of ML algorithms
* 1. Naive Bayes.
* 2. KNN.
* 3. Kmeans.
* 4. Random Forest.
* 5. Tuning algorithms <a href= 'https://www.jeremyjordan.me/hyperparameter-tuning/'>Tuning Hyperparamenters</a>
* 6. Random Forest

I am learning so much, I am glad.
Today landed on the notion of tuning algorithms, I am getting the clearer picture day by day.

## Day 13 Mon 17th July:
 TODAY: I studied this article on the process of Machine learning I documented many steps on what it takes to get good results in the process of ML.

 THOUGHTS: I had not idea it was so cumbersome this process, stages of feature engineering and all, its quite hectic but a great learning process.
   <a href ='https://www.kaggle.com/atwine/start-here-a-gentle-introduction' >Commit</a>

   I recently handed in a submission on kaggle that won me 0.43 percent accuracy, I want to redo it after the manner which i have learnt, then i will gain a better accuracy.
   I will use xgboost, and do better data analysis on my kaggle dataset.

## Day 14 Wed 18th July

   I am continuing to catch up with strategically learning how to manage the ML process from 0 to hero from the guys who have done it before.
   I am hoping to get better at using some of these methods for competitions till I am good enough to win some competitions.
   I haven't finished the first article and there are some few also pending.

## Day 15 Thur  19th July
  Today I am studying mathematical thinking on Coursera
  I am also looking into feature creation as a great part of machine learning.

## Day 16 Friday  20th July

Today I have some time to look into:
- Mathematical thinking from Stanford University
- I am also going to finish my tutorial on feature creation and also machine learning.
- tomorrow I have a finals exam on python for data DataScience so I have to prepare for it and begin to dive into the next module on math and statistics.

## Day 17 Saturday  21th July
- Earned my certificate in Python for DataScience
- begun my classes in statistics and probability


## Day 18 Monday  23th July
- looking at feature creation on kaggle as I get better at machine learning algorithms.

- I am also continuing with my classes on statitics and probability with python, where I am meeting new suprises.
- scratched the surface on pytorch and neural networks, I may need to learn more about these soon.
- Automated Hyperparameter tuning using Hyperopt

###THOUGHTS: in order to be good at this one has to continue learning and practicing the fundamentals of what they know till its part of you.


## Day 20 Wed  25th July
- made some applicationf for data science positions
- Studied loss function choosing criteria
-[automated hyperparameter tuning](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introductory-example-of-bayesian-optimization-in-python-with-hyperopt-aae40fff4ff0)
- THOUGHTS: today I learnt that, once you have cleaned your data and prepared it for training, you need to tune your algorithm of choice, and one of the methods you do so is by using a loss function, what a loss function does is it helps you get the correct values of x for a particular function(ml algorithm) where the los function is equal to 0, so these values are then used to train the model if we want to get accuracy.

Thoughts: I think there are some methods I should look into that help modify how my model behaves
I will soon jump into deep learning, I feel it will make the training process better, so i will use the basic models as the first way I do it then make it better.


## Day 26 Tue 7th Aug
I have not had my laptop for the last few days so my progress has been slow or none

Today i am continuing my classes on edx statistics and probabiliy with python looking at Set theory

## Day 46 Wed 19 Sept
I am taking some insights on machine learning today we are looking at: permutation importance helps in measuring how important a feature is to a dataset and its power to help predictions. If we alter a feature and the loss function or accuracy deteriorates then it will tell us how important that feature is. Ideally we loop through all the features and find which one are the most important for predicting value.

These are the articles I read: [Permutation Importance](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/permutation-importance?utm_medium=email&utm_source=mailchimp&utm_campaign=ml4insights)
<br>
[The Use of Permutation: Use Cases](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/use-cases-for-model-insights)


## Day 47 Thur 20 Sept
Today I am looking at lesson two following yesterday
[Partial Dependence](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/partial-plots?utm_medium=email&utm_source=mailchimp&utm_campaign=ml4insights)

This talks about how a feature effects a model, by altering a feature value in a fitted model one can see how it affects the model.

## Day 48 Fri 21 Sept
I am still finalizing with partial dependency in data analysis. Its still quite confusing for me to understand but I am pushing through before I move on to the next lesson.

I was wondering how to deal with two coordinate values in part of the assignment. When i googled the best spatial libraries I came up with `GeoPandas` I have downloaded the sample notebooks and I am going to look into it as much as I can.

I have learnt that in order to be an effective DataScientist one has to be able to manipulate all sorts of data structures. Tables, images, spatial data, Health data because they all have different formats that they support.

## Day 49 Tue 25 Sept
Today I am taking some time off to look through move 37.
I am looking at the dopamine information
Doing week two of move 37 course
Also I will look at Qlearning for trading.

Today I am going through a basic introduction to python for DataScience from lynda.com I want to master the basics.
I am relooking at pandas and I am happy to learn a few new things.
I learnt some new things about numpy and pandas.
In numpy I leant about the record array and the datetime function.
In pandas I learnt about mulindexing, which helps you analyze data on a different view, it really helps deal with data by viewing its structure well.

## Day 51 Fri 28 Sept
Today I landed on a page of CSS: (page)[www.quackit.com]
I want to look closely at the tutorial so I can learn some things because I will need it later in my business.
